        <p class="projectText">
          Cyber Defense was one of the first complete video games that I finished with a team.
          <br> It started development in a class at Illinois State University, and was finished after I graduated.  Although it's barely playable, it gave me a lot of experience into coding into Unity, as well as working with Audio.
          <br>I worked with the team at Gen Games Studios, a company I helped cofound.
          I was responsible for the music, sfx, and making sure it was implemeneted correctly. I learned how to work with code, and furthered my music skills.
          <br> I think the game came out half finished because at that point, we wanted to move on to the next project. If we were to revisit it, I would make some major edits to the soundtrack as well as get more involved with the coding.
          After looking at this project again it makes me hungry to learn more of Unity's engine as well as more music theory.
